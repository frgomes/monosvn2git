Usage: monosvn2git [-v] [-s] [-u git-user ] [-g git-group] svn-repository monolithic-project-folder authors-file git-repository [workspace]
Converts a remote monolithic SVN repository, splitting its subprojects into separate GIT repositories

Example:
    monosvn2git -u frgomes -g users \\
                      https://jquant.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jquant \\
                      /srv/git-repo/remote-svn/jquantlib \\
                      /srv/git-repo/remote-svn/jquantlib-authors.txt \\
                      /srv/git-repo \\
                      ~/workspace
    . Retrieves projects from monolithic SVN repository at https://jquant.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jquant
    . Converts monolithic SVN repository onto monolithic project folder /srv/git-repo/remote-svn/jquantlib
    . Applies authors-file /srv/git-repo/jquantlib-authors.txt during conversion
    . Splits subprojects from /srv/git-repo/remote-svn/jquantlib to /srv/git-repo
    . Optionally clones projects from /srv/git-repo to ~/workspace

Options:
    -u git-user    uid to be applied to converted GIT repositories
    -g git-group   gid to be applied to converted GIT repositories
    -s             simulate mode; does not perform GIT operations
    -v             verbose
